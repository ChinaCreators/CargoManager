## Develop Work Flow
### Todo
After updating the todo-list before the team discussion,we should show the items on the list.What we need to do is create a new issue on the repository page with a label called **dev_todo**.
### Start Work
As soon as you choose a todo item form the todo-list,you need to delete the issue which represents this todo item,and then,you should create a new branch which will be named by the todo item's content and create a pull request at the same time(* but do not invite anyone to make a code review at this time *).It means this item is in progress.In this way,everyone can see the others' work progress.
### Finish Work
When you think you have finished your work,you can invite **creatorlxd** to make a code review.If your code review is approved by creatorlxd,your work is finished and your pull request will be merged into the master branch,or you will need to change your code until it's approved.
